# Weather-Site

* This project was built using HTML, CSS/Bootstrap and Javascript/jQuery

* This was my week-6 assignment for my Full Stake Development course

* I wrote all of the code for this site, there was no predifened code

* This project is using both Moment.js and the OpenWeather api

* This project is currently live on github pages at https://hockeyduck3.github.io/Weather-Site/

For this assignment we had to go in and make a fully functioning weather site using the OpenWeather api.
Unlike other projects I've made for class, this one took me the longest to make. Other projects I was able to get done in a weekend, this one took me a full week.
I really wanted to push myself with this project, making sure everything was nice and smooth, everything functioned the way you'd expect, and I believe I have achieved that. (This project was my first time using a modal). Overall I'm happy with how this project turned out!
